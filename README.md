# monster-killer-game

This project is a battle between player versus monster, in which the user has four options: attack, use the 'strong attack' option, recover the player and show the event log. 
It is possible to set the strength of each attack, both the player and the monster, as the 'strong attack', and also the player's recovery.
The technologies used in this project were JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
